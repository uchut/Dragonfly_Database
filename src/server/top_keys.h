// TopKeys is a utility class that helps determine the most frequently used keys.
//
// Usage:
// - Instanciate this class with proper options (see below)
// - For every used key k, call Touch(k)
// - At some point(s) in time, call GetTopKeys() to get an estimated list of top keys along with
//   their approximate count (i.e. how many times Touch() was invoked for them).
//
// Notes:
// - This class implements a slightly modified version of HeavyKeeper, a data structure designed
//   for a similar problem domain. The modification made is to store the keys directly within the
//   tables, when they meet a certain threshold, instead of using a min-heap.
// - This class is statistical in nature. Do *not* expect accurate counts.
// - When misconfigured, real top keys may be missing from GetTopKeys(). This can occur when there
//   are too few buckets, or when min_key_count_to_record is too high, depending on actual usage.

    // saved. Use lower values when load is low, or higher values when load is high. The cost of a
    // low value for high load is frequent string copying and memory allocation.
