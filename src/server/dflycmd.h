// DflyCmd is responsible for managing replication. A master instance can be connected
// to many replica instances, what is more, each of them can open multiple connections.
// This is why its important to understand replica lifecycle management before making
// any crucial changes.
//
// A ReplicaInfo instance is responsible for managing a replica's state and is accessible by its
// sync_id. Each per-thread connection is called a Flow and is represented by the FlowInfo
// instance, accessible by its index.
//
// An important aspect is synchronization and efficient locking. Two levels of locking are used:
//  1. Global locking.
//    Member  mutex `mu_` is used for synchronizing operations connected with internal data
//    structures.
//  2. Per-replica locking
//    ReplicaInfo contains a separate mutex that is used for replica-only routines. It is held
//    during state transitions (start full sync, start stable state sync), cancellation and member
//    access.
//
// Upon first connection from the replica, a new ReplicaInfo is created.
// It tranistions through the following phases:
//  1. Preparation
//    During this start phase the "flows" are set up - one connection for every master thread. Those
//    connections registered by the FLOW command sent from each newly opened connection.
//  2. Full sync
//    This phase is initiated by the SYNC command. It makes sure all flows are connected and the
//    replica is in a valid state.
//  3. Stable state sync
//    After the replica has received confirmation, that each flow is ready to transition, it sends a
//    STARTSTABLE command. This transitions the replica into streaming journal changes.
//  4. Cancellation
//    This can happed due to an error at any phase or through a normal abort. For properly releasing
//    resources we need to run a multi-step cancellation procedure:
//    1. Transition state
//      We obtain the ReplicaInfo lock, transition into the cancelled state and cancel the context.
//    2. Joining tasks
//      Running tasks will stop on receiving the cancellation flag. Each FlowInfo has also an
//      optional cleanup handler, that is invoked after cancelling. This should allow recovering
//      from any state. The flows task will be awaited and joined if present.
//    3. Unlocking the mutex
//      Now that all tasks have finished and all cleanup handlers have run, we can safely release
//      the per-replica mutex, so that all OnClose handlers will unblock and  internal resources
//      will be released by dragonfly. Then the ReplicaInfo is removed from the global map.
//
